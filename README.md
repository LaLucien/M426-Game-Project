## Building the Windows Installer

The Unity Files were exported and build with the [build script](Project/Builds/installer_build.iss) using this [guide](https://www.programonaut.com/how-to-create-a-windows-installer-for-your-unity-game/) the exported build files should be put in this [folder](Project/Builds/ToBuild), the installer can then be found in this [folder](Project/Builds/Output)
